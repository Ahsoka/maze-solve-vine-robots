# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why the line graph is implicit
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The line graph has 2m nodes (one per directed traversal of a visibility
# edge) and
#
#     sum_v deg(v) * (deg(v) - 1)
#
# arcs. That count is driven by the *second moment* of the degree
# distribution, so a handful of high-degree vertices in an open region cost
# far more than the average degree suggests. At n = 5,000 vertices with mean
# degree 50 it is roughly 12 million arcs; materialising them as an object
# graph with tuple keys and a per-arc attribute dict runs to several
# gigabytes, and the numpy intermediates needed to build it are another
# gigabyte on top.
#
# None of it has to exist. Storing the visibility graph in CSR over *directed*
# edges makes the successors of the line-graph node e = (u, v) exactly the
# contiguous slice
#
#     indices[indptr[v] : indptr[v + 1]]
#
# so a line-graph node is just an index into the CSR arrays and its successor
# set is a slice view. The whole structure is then the CSR itself plus three
# companion arrays of length 2m, on the order of ten megabytes at the size
# above.
#
# The multiplicative factor is what forces the issue rather than merely
# rewarding it. The affine update is
#
#     tau' = alpha * tau + beta,   alpha = exp(mu_c * theta),  beta = f * l_out
#
# and beta depends only on the outgoing edge, so it is a 2m array. alpha
# depends on the *arc*, so there are sum deg^2 of them and they cannot be
# stored at any useful size. They are computed one deg(v)-wide vector per pop
# instead, from precomputed unit direction vectors.
#
#
# Why one-pass Dijkstra is valid
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The augmented state (directed edge, accumulated tension) restores the Markov
# property that the raw vertex state loses, and the DP mapping H = alpha J +
# beta is monotone for alpha > 0. This is Bertsekas' affine monotonic model
# (Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, section 4.5). With
#
#     alpha >= 1   and   beta >= 0
#
# labels are nondecreasing along every path, which is precisely the condition
# that makes label-setting sound: the minimum open label can never be improved
# by a longer prefix, so a settled node stays settled. Both hold here whenever
# mu_c >= 0 and f >= 0, and the constructor checks them rather than assuming.
#
# The minimum-turning planner is the same recursion with alpha == 1 and
# beta = theta, so it runs through the identical kernel. That is deliberate:
# the proxy-metric baseline differs from the proposed planner only in dropping
# the multiplicative coupling, and sharing the graph, the queue and the tie
# breaking removes any question of the baseline being handicapped by a
# separate implementation.

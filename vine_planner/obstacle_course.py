        """Generate a random course anchored on two opposite corner barriers.

        Two barriers are built, one across the bottom-left quadrant and a
        mirrored one across the top-right quadrant. Splitting a quadrant in
        four again, its barrier is forced to reach into two opposite
        sub-quadrants, and in each of those the point is pushed hard
        against the outer wall: within ``wall_fraction`` of the course
        dimension. So the bottom-left barrier runs from the left wall to
        the floor, sealing off the origin, and the top-right barrier
        mirrors it.

        Every further barrier vertex is drawn from the quadrant with the
        current hull cut out of it, which puts the new point outside the
        hull by construction and so makes it a vertex of the grown hull.

        The remaining obstacles have vertices sampled the standard way, at
        a random angle and a random radius from a thin annulus. Their
        centers come from three places: near ``(0, height)``, near
        ``(width, 0)``, and along four lines derived from paths through the
        two corner barriers. A temporary two-obstacle course is solved from
        ``(0, 0)`` to ``(width, height)`` with ``PathPlanner``. The shortest
        path is retained first. The next retained path is the shortest path
        whose direct A-to-B segment shares neither its obstacle-A endpoint
        nor its obstacle-B endpoint with the first path's segment. Each
        direct segment
        is translated vertically by ``-radius / 2`` and ``+radius / 2``,
        producing four placement lines. The remaining obstacle count is
        divided between the two original direct segments in proportion to
        their usable segment lengths. For each original direct segment, the
        combined centers assigned to its two translated lines are then spaced
        evenly along the original segment. Those centerline points
        are then alternately projected vertically onto the lower and upper
        translated lines. This staggers neighboring obstacles instead of
        placing opposing obstacles at nearly the same longitudinal position.
        Together with the two barriers and the two corner clusters, all four
        corners are always occupied, so the course always holds at least
        four obstacles.

        Every standard obstacle is sampled against the current Shapely
        free-space geometry. Before an obstacle is accepted, the union of all
        previously generated polygons is subtracted from the complete course
        region with ``shapely.difference``. All sampled vertices and the full
        candidate polygon must be covered by that free-space region, so
        obstacle interiors cannot overlap.

        Parameters
        ----------
        radius:
            Inner sampling radius, ``min_radius``. Defaults to four
            percent of the smaller course dimension.
        annulus_fraction:
            ``max_radius`` is ``radius`` plus this fraction of
            ``min(width, height)``.
        wall_fraction:
            How close to the wall the two required barrier points are
            pushed, as a fraction of the course dimension.
        corner_obstacles:
            Obstacles placed at each of ``(0, height)`` and
            ``(width, 0)``.
        corner_span_fraction:
            Size of the box those centers are drawn from, as a fraction of
            the course dimensions.
        min_vertices, max_vertices:
            Bounds on the vertex count, inclusive.

# A wall is a *box*, not a quad: ``thickness`` deep along its own normal into
# the interior of the voxel that owns it, and grown by ``dilation`` in its own
# plane.  The dilation is what makes the model work.  Testing a segment
# against each wall separately is only sound when
#
#     int(union of the walls) == union of int(each wall),
#
# and with flat quads every interior is empty, so the identity fails
# everywhere: two walls that merely touch leave a seam that lies on the
# boundary of both, and a segment through it grazes each one and is reported
# clear by both.  Growing every wall by the same ``dilation`` turns every
# contact -- coplanar edge to edge, coplanar corner to corner, perpendicular
# along an edge, and perpendicular at a single point -- into an overlap with
# positive volume, which restores the identity.  A segment through any former
# seam now enters the interior of at least one box and is caught.
#
# Only the outermost walls of the course extend past its boundary, and only by
# ``dilation``; vertices that land outside are dropped, since nothing can
# reach them.

        Each box is clipped independently, which the dilation makes sound (see
